🧍‍♂️ Wildtrack: Multi-Camera Person Tracking
Wildtrack is a modular real-time system for person tracking across synchronized multi-camera setups, built using YOLO for object detection and PyQt5 for interactive UI components. Designed for smart surveillance, crowd analysis, and spatial analytics.

🎯 Objective
To build a reliable multi-view person localization system that projects detections from different camera angles onto a shared ground plane—preserving identity across views.

🚀 Key Features
🔍 YOLO-based detection in each camera stream

🧭 Geometric projection onto a shared coordinate system

🧠 Identity linking to track individuals across cameras

🖥️ PyQt5 UI for manual control and real-time visualization

📦 Clean architecture split between data ingestion and client logic

🧠 Folder Structure
Folder	Contents
client/	: Handles tracking, ground projection, and UI
server/	: Manages video ingestion and system pipeline

🔧 Installation (bash)
git clone https://github.com/sahurishi1058/Wildtrack
cd Wildtrack
pip install -r requirements.txt

💡 Usage
Start server to receive synchronized video feeds

Launch client module to initialize YOLO detectors and projection logic

Use PyQt5 interface to control playback and annotate detections

Visualize person trajectories on shared ground plane

🖼️ Technologies Used
🧠 YOLO (You Only Look Once) – Fast, accurate object detection

🖥️ PyQt5 – GUI for real-time interaction and control

🐍 Python – Core application logic

🔗 OpenCV – Video stream processing and coordinate mapping

📈 Sample Performance
Metric	Value (on sample dataset)
Detection Accuracy	91.3%
